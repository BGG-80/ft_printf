# ft_printf
The objective of this project is quite simple. You will have to reprogram printf(). You will mainly learn how to use a variable number of arguments.

If you want to write a good ft_printf my advice is the following: 
**Block 1: Review C Fundamentals** Affecting ft_printf, some of these functions are part of your libft, maybe , depends on how you write the code you will need to adapt them. 

    Key concepts: memory, pointers, and structures.
    String manipulation: ft_strlen, ft_strchr, ft_strdup, ft_strjoin.
    Handling va_list to manage  variable number of arguments.
    Using write() and differences with printf.

**Block 2: Progressive Construction of ft_printf**

    Problem breakdown: what ft_printf should do and how to divide it.
    Format processing: (%c, %s, %d, %x, etc.).
    Do you want to work on the bonus part? build your ft_printf thinking to handle flags: -, 0, +, , # from the begining.

 Compare your function with the original printf!. 
 Enjoy!
